#### Practice Problem 6

What is the return value of the following statement? Why?

```ruby
['ant', 'bear', 'caterpillar'].pop.size
```

<ins>**Solution**</ins>: 

Here the `pop` method removes the last element and returns it. In this case, it will be `['caterpillar']` that will be returned. After that, we are calling `size` method which returns the number of characters in the 'ant'. 

The return is: 

```ruby
#=> 11
```
