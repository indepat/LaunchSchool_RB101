We have most of the Munster family in our age hash:

```ruby
ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 5843, "Eddie" => 10 }
```

add ages for Marilyn and Spot to the existing hash

```ruby
additional_ages = { "Marilyn" => 22, "Spot" => 237 }
```

<ins>**Solution**</ins>: 

```ruby
ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 5843, "Eddie" => 10 }
additional_ages = { "Marilyn" => 22, "Spot" => 237 }
ages.merge(additional_ages)
#=> {"Herman"=>32, "Lily"=>30, "Grandpa"=>5843, "Eddie"=>10, "Marilyn"=>22, "Spot"=>237}
```
