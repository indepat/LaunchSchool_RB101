Describe the difference between `!` and `?` in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

1. what is `!=` and where should you use it?

   <ins>**Answer**</ins>: `!=` is `not equals`

2. put `!` before something, like `!user_name`

   <ins>**Answer**</ins>: It turns the object into their opposite Boolean equivalent

3. put `!` after something, like `words.uniq!`

   <ins>**Answer**</ins>: It becomes part of the method name and it might change the method implementation. 

4. put `?` before something

   <ins>**Answer**</ins>: `? :` is the ternary operator for if...else

5. put `?` after something

   <ins>**Answer**</ins>: It's part of the method and varies according to the method implementation. 

6. put `!!` before something, like `!!user_name`

   <ins>**Answer**</ins>: It turns the object into their Boolean equivalent
