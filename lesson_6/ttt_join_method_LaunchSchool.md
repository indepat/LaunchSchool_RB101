# Assignment: TTT Bonus Features

At this point you should have a simple  command line Tic Tac Toe game working properly. Let's try to add some  additional features.

1. Improved "join"

   If we run the current game, we'll see the following prompt:

   ```none
   => Choose a position to place a piece: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
   ```

   This is ok, but we'd like for this message to read a little better.  We want to separate the last item with a "or", so that it reads:

   ```none
   => Choose a position to place a piece: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9
   ```

   Currently, we're using the `Array#join` method, which can  only insert a delimiter between the array elements, and isn't smart  enough to display a joining word for the last element.

   Write a method called `joinor` that will produce the following result:

   ```ruby
   joinor([1, 2])                   # => "1 or 2"
   joinor([1, 2, 3])                # => "1, 2, or 3"
   joinor([1, 2, 3], '; ')          # => "1; 2; or 3"
   joinor([1, 2, 3], ', ', 'and')   # => "1, 2, and 3"
   ```

Then, use this method in the TTT game when prompting the user to mark a square.

```ruby
def joinor(arr, delimiter=', ', word='or')
  case arr.size
  when 0 then ''
  when 1 then arr.first
  when 2 then arr.join(" #{word} ")
  else
    arr[-1] = "#{word} #{arr.last}"
    arr.join(delimiter)
  end
end
```

Using a `case` statement works well here because we need to perform different actions based on the number of elements in `arr`. If `arr` has 2 elements, then a delimiter isn't required and we can just print the 2 elements, separated by the value of `word`. If `arr` has more than 2 elements, then we permanently mutate the last element with `arr[-1] =` and prepend the value of `word`. After we've modified the last array element, we can just use `Array#join` to join the elements.

Then, you could use it in the game like this:

```ruby
prompt "Choose a position to place a piece: #{joinor(empty_squares(brd))}"
```
