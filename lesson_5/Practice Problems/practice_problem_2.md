How would you order this array of hashes based on the year of publication of each book, from the earliest to the latest?

```ruby
books = [
  {title: 'One Hundred Years of Solitude', author: 'Gabriel Garcia Marquez', published: '1967'},
  {title: 'The Great Gatsby', author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', published: '1925'},
  {title: 'War and Peace', author: 'Leo Tolstoy', published: '1869'},
  {title: 'Ulysses', author: 'James Joyce', published: '1922'}
]
```



Here we will have to sort on each hashes by using `hash#sort_by` method. Since the method `sort_by` will use the set of key used in the block by mapping the corresponding values. 

Therefore, we will have: 

```ruby
books = [
  {title: 'One Hundred Years of Solitude', author: 'Gabriel Garcia Marquez', published: '1967'},
  {title: 'The Great Gatsby', author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', published: '1925'},
  {title: 'War and Peace', author: 'Leo Tolstoy', published: '1869'},
  {title: 'Ulysses', author: 'James Joyce', published: '1922'}
]

books.sort_by do |book|
  book[:published]
end
```
